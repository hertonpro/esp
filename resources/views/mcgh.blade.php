                        <p class="text-justify">A Master in Community and Global Health is a postgraduate degree that focuses on the
                            interconnectedness between the health of humans, animals, and the environment. It is a
                            multidisciplinary field that draws on knowledge from public health, veterinary medicine,
                            environmental science, and other disciplines.</p>
                        <p class="text-justify">
                            Community and global health are inextricably linked. The health of a community has a direct
                            impact on the health of the global population, and vice versa. Animals and ecosystems play a
                            vital role in both community and global health.</p>

                                <p class="text-justify">On the one hand, animals can play a positive role in human health by providing
                                    companionship, reducing stress, and encouraging physical activity. They can also be a
                                    source of food and other resources essential for human survival. Additionally, healthy
                                    ecosystems provide a number of benefits for human health, including clean air and water,
                                    food security, and biodiversity.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">On the other hand, animals can also be a source of disease and injury. Additionally, the
                                    destruction of ecosystems can have a negative impact on human health by disrupting the
                                    availability of food and water, increasing exposure to pollutants, and reducing
                                    biodiversity. </p>

                    <p class="text-justify">The destruction of ecosystems can also have a negative impact on human health in more indirect ways.
                        For example, the loss of biodiversity can lead to the spread of invasive species that can harm human
                        health. Additionally, climate change, which is largely caused by human activities, is having a
                        significant impact on ecosystems around the world. Climate change is also having a negative impact
                        on human health, through increased exposure to extreme weather events, heat waves, and air
                        pollution. </p>
                    <p class="text-justify">It is important to protect animals and ecosystems in order to safeguard community and global health.
                        This can be done by reducing our reliance on animal products, supporting sustainable agricultural
                        practices, and protecting natural habitats.</p>
